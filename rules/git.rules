# Git Workflow Rules

rules:
    commit_standards:
        - Use conventional commits format (type: description)
        - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
        - Keep commits atomic and focused
        - Commit messages must be descriptive and in present tense
        - Reference issues in commits where applicable

    branch_management:
        - Use feature branches for all new work
        - Branch naming: type/description (e.g., feat/add-markdown-processor)
        - Keep branches up to date with main
        - Delete branches after merging

    pull_requests:
        - Include description of changes
        - Link related issues
        - Update documentation if needed
        - Ensure all tests pass
        - Request review from at least one team member
