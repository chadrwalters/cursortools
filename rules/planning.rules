                # Summary
                Brief description of what we're trying to accomplish.

                # Assumptions
                - Key assumption 1
                - Key assumption 2

                # References
                - Files: `dir/file` - Description of relevance
                - Libraries: `http://library.com` - Why we need it
                - Documentation: `http://docs.com` - What it provides

                # Implementation Steps
                1. First step (`dir/file`)
                   - Details of what needs to change
                   - Expected outcome
                2. Second step (`another/file`)
                   - Specific changes needed
                   - Dependencies on previous steps

                # Confidence Level
                - **High** confidence in: X
                - **Medium** confidence in: Y
                - **Low** confidence in: Z - Requires investigation

                # Questions
                1. Question about implementation approach?
                2. Unclear requirements to resolve?
