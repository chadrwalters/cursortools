# Structure Rules
# Defines the organization and targeting of rule files

rules:
    organization:
        base_rules:
            - "All rules must be in .cursor/rules/"
            - "No subdirectories allowed in rules folder"
            - "Use descriptive filenames ending in .rules"
            - "Each rules file must have a single clear purpose"

    targeting:
        glob_patterns:
            python: "**.py"
            tests: "tests/**/*.py"
            docs: "docs/**/*.md"
            config: "config/**/*"

    rule_format:
        - "Each file must start with # comment describing purpose"
        - "Use YAML-style rules structure"
        - "Include glob pattern if file-specific"
        - "Group related rules under logical headers"

    file_operations:
        reading:
            forbidden:
                - "NEVER use CAT command"
                - "NEVER use direct file system commands"
            required:
                - "Use read_file tool for all file reading"
                - "Use open_file tag in conversation for file context"
        writing:
            - "Use proper edit blocks for file modifications"
            - "Always include file path in code blocks"
            - "Use diff format when showing changes"
