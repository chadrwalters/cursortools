# Python Best Practices Rules
# Applies to: **.py

rules:
    python_standards:
        - Use Python 3.12+ features where applicable
        - Type hints are REQUIRED for all function parameters and return types
        - Use dataclasses for data structures
        - Follow PEP 8 style guide strictly
        - Use pathlib instead of os.path for file operations
        - Use f-strings for string formatting
        - Use context managers (with statements) for file and resource handling

    code_quality:
        - Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
        - Use Black for code formatting
        - Use isort for import sorting
        - Use pylint for linting
        - Use mypy for type checking
        - Docstrings required for all public functions and classes

    error_handling:
        - Use specific exception types instead of bare except clauses
        - Always include error messages in exceptions
        - Log exceptions with appropriate log levels
        - Use custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
